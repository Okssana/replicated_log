To ensure your secondary nodes (`secondary1.py` and `secondary2.py`) align with the requirements of the Log-3 task, there are several features and changes you should consider implementing. Since I can't view the contents of the files directly, I will provide a general outline of changes that are typically necessary based on the Log-3 task requirements.

### 1. Handling Message Replication:

* **Receive and Store Messages** : Ensure that each secondary node can receive replicated messages from the master and store them in their local log.
* **Implement Deduplication** : Each secondary should have logic to check if an incoming message is a duplicate and avoid storing it multiple times.

### 2. Maintaining Total Order:

* **Sequence Number Handling** : If you've implemented a sequencing mechanism in the master (where each message is sent with a sequence number), each secondary should use this sequence number to maintain the total order of messages.
* **Order Consistency** : The secondary should only process/display messages in the correct sequence. If a message is received out of order (e.g., it receives message 4 before message 3), it should wait for the missing messages before processing further.

### 3. Syncing Missed Messages:

* **Endpoint for Syncing** : Implement an endpoint in each secondary service that the master can call to sync missed messages when the secondary comes back online.
* **Handling Sync Requests** : When a sync request is received, the secondary should be able to identify which messages it missed and request them from the master.

### 4. Health Check Endpoint:

* **Implement Health Checks** : Ensure there is an endpoint in each secondary service that returns the current health status, which can be used by the master to check if a secondary is available or not.

### Example Code Snippet:

Here's an example snippet showing how you might handle a replicated message in a secondary:

```python
@app.route('/replicate', methods=['POST'])
def replicate():
    message = request.json['message']
    sequence_number = request.json['sequence_number']

    # Check for deduplication and sequence order
    if is_valid_message(message, sequence_number):
        # Store the message in the log
        log.append({'sequence_number': sequence_number, 'message': message})
        return jsonify({'status': 'success'}), 200
    else:
        # Handle out-of-order or duplicate message
        return jsonify({'status': 'error', 'message': 'Message out of order or duplicate'}), 400

def is_valid_message(message, sequence_number):
    # Logic to check if the message is in order and not a duplicate
    # ...

```

Based on the `secondary1.py` script you've provided and considering the requirements of your Log-3 task, let's go through the necessary enhancements:

### 1. Message Deduplication

* **Already Implemented** : Your script already handles deduplication. It checks if a received message is already in the log before appending it.

### 2. Handling Artificial Delay

* **Already Implemented** : You have implemented an artificial delay, which can be configured via an environment variable. This simulates the asynchronous behavior of the secondary node.

### 3. Maintaining Total Order

* **Requires Implementation** : You need to modify the secondary to handle sequence numbers for maintaining total order. Each message should have an associated sequence number, and the secondary should process messages in the order of their sequence numbers.

### 4. Handling Replication of Missed Messages

* **Requires Implementation** : For the secondary to catch up on missed messages when it comes back online, it needs to have a way to communicate with the master about the last message it successfully processed and request any missed messages.

### Modified Code Snippet for `secondary1.py`:

To handle **total ordering and missed messages,** consider the following changes (assuming each message now contains a `sequence_number`):

```python
@app.route('/replicate', methods=['POST'])
def replicate():
    global last_processed_sequence
    logging.info("Replicate endpoint hit with a POST request.")
  
    try:
        message_data = request.json
        message = message_data['message']
        sequence_number = message_data['sequence_number']

        if not message or not isinstance(message, str):
            logging.warning("Invalid message format")
            return jsonify({'status': 'error', 'message': 'Invalid message format'}), 400

        # Ensure total ordering
        if sequence_number == last_processed_sequence + 1:
            if message not in log:  # Deduplication check
                log.append({'sequence_number': sequence_number, 'message': message})
                last_processed_sequence = sequence_number
                logging.info(f"Appended message: {message}")
            else:
                logging.info(f"Duplicate message received: {message}")
        else:
            return jsonify({'status': 'error', 'message': 'Message received out of order'}), 400

        time.sleep(ARTIFICIAL_DELAY)
        return jsonify({'status': 'ACK'}), 200

    except (TypeError, KeyError):
        logging.exception("Failed to replicate message")
        return jsonify({'status': 'error', 'message': 'Bad request'}), 400

```



### Simple Explanation:

* **Total Order** : Think of messages like numbered pages of a book. The secondary node should place each page in its correct order, not skipping or duplicating any pages.
* **Missed Messages** : If the secondary node misses some pages (messages), it needs a way to tell the master, "Hey, I am missing pages 10 to 15, can you send them again?" This part requires additional logic to request missing messages from the master.

This modified code ensures that each secondary node processes messages in the correct sequence and does not duplicate them. However, for complete functionality, you'd also need to implement a mechanism on the master node to handle requests for missed messages from secondary nodes.

### Explanation:

1. **Global Variables** : `log` is used to store the messages, and `last_processed_sequence` keeps track of the last sequence number processed.
2. **Environment Variable** : `ARTIFICIAL_DELAY` sets an artificial delay for replication, simulating asynchronous behavior.
3. **Endpoints** :

* `@app.route("/")`: Returns a greeting, indicating the service is running.
* `@app.route("/health")`: Health check endpoint.
* `@app.route('/replicate', methods=['POST'])`: Handles incoming replication requests.

1. **Replication Logic** :

* Extracts the message and its sequence number from the incoming request.
* Checks for total ordering: The sequence number should be exactly one more than the last processed sequence number.
* If the order is correct and the message is not a duplicate, appends it to the log.
* Responds with an acknowledgment after an artificial delay.

1. **Error Handling** : Catches and logs errors if there are issues with the request format.
2. **Listing Messages** : `@app.route('/messages', methods=['GET'])` provides an endpoint to retrieve all stored messages.

This script ensures that each secondary node maintains the total order of messages and avoids duplicates. However, the functionality for syncing missed messages when a node comes back online after downtime still requires corresponding logic on the master node to handle such requests.
