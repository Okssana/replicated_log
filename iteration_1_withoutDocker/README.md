#####**Can you make the first step Step 1: Implementing the Master Server more simpler. Without using complicated functions, and how do I find secondary servers? **



#####Simplified Master Server

Here's a more straightforward version of the Master Server using **Flask**:

`**master.py**`


**Explanation:**

	*     log: A list that stores messages.
	*     secondaries: A list that contains the URLs of all secondary servers.
	*     post_message(): A function that handles POST requests. It adds the message to the log and sends it to all secondary servers for replication.
	*     get_messages(): A function that handles GET requests. It returns all messages in the log.


**Finding Secondary Servers:**

   	Hard-Coding (as shown above):
        Directly specify the IP addresses/URLs of secondary servers in the code.
        Pros: Simple and straightforward.
        Cons: Not scalable and requires code changes for server additions/removals.

    Service Discovery:
        Use a service discovery tool like Consul, Eureka, or Zookeeper.
        Secondary servers register themselves with the service discovery tool.
        The Master server queries the service discovery tool to get the list of secondary servers.
        Pros: Scalable and no need to change code for server additions/removals.
        Cons: Additional component to manage.

    Environment Variables:
        Specify secondary servers as environment variables.
        Read these variables in your code to get the list of secondary servers.
        Pros: No need to hard-code server addresses in the code.
        Cons: Requires environment variable management.

    Configuration File:
        Maintain a configuration file that contains the addresses of all secondary servers.
        The Master server reads this file to get the list of secondary servers.
        Pros: Easy to manage and no need to change code for server additions/removals.
        Cons: Requires manual update of the configuration file.

    DNS Round Robin:
        Use DNS to resolve a single domain name to multiple IP addresses of secondary servers.
        Pros: Simple DNS setup and no need to manage server lists in the application.
        Cons: Limited load balancing and fault tolerance capabilities.

Choose a method based on your use case, scalability needs, and management overhead you are willing to handle. If you're building a small application or a prototype, hard-coding or environment variables might be sufficient. For larger, dynamic, or production environments, service discovery or DNS might be more appropriate.


####Service Discovery? 

Absolutely, let's delve into "Service Discovery"!
What is Service Discovery?

Imagine you live in a large city and you're looking for all the pizza places. You might use a map or an app to find them. In the world of distributed systems (multiple computers working together), "Service Discovery" is like that map or app but for finding services (like servers) within the system.

In simpler terms:

    Service: A program or a server that provides some functionality, like storing messages.
    Discovery: Finding something.

So, "Service Discovery" involves:

    Registering: When a service (server) starts up, it tells a central "registry" about its existence and how it can be reached (its address, port, etc.).
    Discovering: When another service wants to find and communicate with registered services, it asks the registry where to find them.

Why is it Important?

In a system with many servers, knowing where each server is can be tricky, especially if servers are frequently added or removed. Service Discovery helps manage this by keeping track of all available servers in a central place.
Basic Components:

    Service Registry: A database or a system that keeps track of all available services.
    Service Registrar: A service that registers its availability with the service registry.
    Service Consumer: A service that queries the service registry to discover and access other services.

Example:

Let's say we have:

    Pizza Service: Provides various pizzas.
    Delivery Service: Delivers pizzas to customers.

If a customer orders a pizza for delivery:

    Registering: The Pizza Service tells a central registry, "I'm here, and this is how you can reach me".
    Discovering: The Delivery Service asks the registry, "Where is the Pizza Service?".
    The registry tells the Delivery Service how to find the Pizza Service.
    The Delivery Service communicates directly with the Pizza Service to fulfill the order.

In the Provided Code:

The code I provided earlier does not implement Service Discovery; it uses a hard-coded list of secondary servers:


`secondaries = ["http://localhost:5001", "http://localhost:5002"]`



To implement Service Discovery, you might use a tool like **Consul, Eureka, or Zookeeper**, which would involve:

	*     Secondary servers registering themselves when they start up.
	*     The Master server querying the tool to find all registered secondary servers.

	
###Simplified Example with Service Discovery:

**master.py**


	from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
	import requests
	
	app = Flask(__name__)
	log = []
	
	def discover_secondaries():
	    # This function should query the service discovery tool (like Consul) to get the list of secondary servers.
	    # For simplicity, returning a hard-coded list here.
	    return ["http://localhost:5001", "http://localhost:5002"]
	
	@app.route('/messages', methods=['POST'])
	def post_message():
	    message = request.json['message']
	    log.append(message)
	    
	    secondaries = discover_secondaries()  # Discover secondary servers
	    
	    for secondary in secondaries:
	        response = requests.post(f"{secondary}/replicate", json={'message': message})
	        if response.status_code != 200:
	            return jsonify({'status': 'error', 'message': 'Replication failed'}), 500
	    
	    return jsonify({'status': 'success'}), 200
	
	@app.route('/messages', methods=['GET'])
	def get_messages():
	    return jsonify({'messages': log}), 200
	
	if __name__ == "__main__":
	    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)



In a real-world scenario, **discover_secondaries()** would query the service discovery tool to get the list of available secondary servers instead of returning a hard-coded list.

I hope this helps clarify the concept of Service Discovery! If you have more questions or need further explanation, feel free to ask.




####**What is the output "Simplified Master Server" part of code I expect when I run it?**


When you run the "Simplified Master Server" code, it starts a web server using Flask, which listens on port **5000** and exposes two HTTP endpoints: **/messages** for **GET** and **POST** methods. Here's what you can expect:

**Running the Server**

When you run the code, you might not see any output in the terminal/console if everything is working correctly. The server will just start and wait for incoming HTTP requests. If you're running this in a script, you might execute it with Python like so:

**Run code:**

`python master_server.py`




**Interacting with the Server**

1. POST Request to **/messages**

When you send a **POST** request to **http://localhost:5000/messages** with a JSON payload containing a message, the server:

	*     Appends the message to the log list.
	*     Sends the message to all secondary servers for replication.
	*     Waits for acknowledgment from all secondary servers.
	*     Returns a JSON response.

	
	
**Example POST Request:**


`{
    "message": "Hello, this is a test message!"
}
`


**Expected Output:**

If all secondary servers acknowledge the replication:

`{
    "status": "success"
}`


If any secondary server fails to acknowledge:

	{
	    "status": "error",
	    "message": "Replication failed"
	}


2. GET Request to **/messages**

When you send a **GET** request to **http://localhost:5000/messages**, the server:

    Returns all messages stored in the log list in a JSON format.

**Expected Output:**

	{
	    "messages": ["Hello, this is a test message!", "Another message"]
	}
	
	
**Testing with curl**

You can use **curl** to test the server from the command line:

**Sending a POST Request:**

	curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message":"Hello, this is a test message!"}' http://localhost:5000/messages

**Sending a GET Request:**
	
	curl http://localhost:5000/messages



**Note**

Ensure that:

	*     The secondary servers are running and reachable at the addresses specified in the discover_secondaries() function.
	*     If you're running this on a machine with a firewall or in a virtual environment, ensure that port 5000 is open and accessible.
	*     If you're testing with a tool like Postman, set the body type to raw and JSON (application/json) for POST requests.



## Logististics: step-by-step:


1) Firstly  you need to run the master server. You can do this by running "`python master.py"` in the terminal.

2) To test the master server, you can use the following curl commands in the different terminal windows:

	curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message":"Hello, this is a test message 1!"}' http://localhost:5001/messages

	curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message":"Hello, this is a test message 2!"}' http://localhost:5001/messages

3) You can also visit [http://localhost:5001/messages ]()in your browser to see the messages in the log.
or [http://127.0.0.1:5001/messages]() -- for testing purposes

	http://localhost/ = http://127.0.0.1/

4) `curl http://localhost:5001/messages `-- to get all messages from the master server (primary server)



5) `http://127.0.0.1:5004/messages `

If we send requests, we get:

	{
	  "messages": [
	    "Hello, this is a test message 3!",
	    "Hello, this is a test message 1 for 5004!",
	    "Test to secondary!"
	  ]
	}



6) Test in the command line:

 `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message":"Test to secondary!"}' http://localhost:5004/replicate
`

The result would be:

	{
	  "status": "ACK"
	}

And in [http://127.0.0.1:5004/messages](http://127.0.0.1:5004/messages)


	{
	  "messages": [
	    "Hello, this is a test message 3!",
	    "Hello, this is a test message 1 for 5004!",
	    "Test to secondary!"
	  ]
	}


**Check 5004 port**

	curl http://localhost:5004/messages


After running `python3 master.py`. 

The output is:


	(uku_data) Oksana@Oksanas-MacBook-Pro iteration_1_withoutDocker % python3 master.py

    To test the POST method for /messages, you can use curl or Postman to send a POST request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/messages.
    
   
**Check ports:**
    
	lsof -i :5000
	



#### Why do I use port=5001 here, in my master code I have port=5000 in if __name__ == "__main__": ? 


In the context provided, the master server and the secondary server are separate entities, each running its own Flask application. Therefore, they need to run on different ports to avoid conflicts since a port can only be used by one application at a time.
Why Different Ports:

    Master Server: In your master server code, it's set to run on port 5000. This is the application that you interact with to post new messages and get all messages.
    

Код

    if __name__ == "__main__":
    	app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)


**Secondary Server:**

The secondary server(s) are meant to replicate the data from the master server. If you're running the secondary server on the same machine as the master server, it needs to use a different port. In the example, it's set to run on port 5001.


	if __name__ == "__main__":
	    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)
